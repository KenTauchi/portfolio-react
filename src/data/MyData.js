      "Back when I was in high school, my English grade was always one of the worst in the school. One day I noticed myself enjoying using what I studied and found a purpose to learn. Since then my English grade improved to one of the top in the school. This gave me the motivation to reach my potential by continuing to challenge myself. I eventually graduated from a University in the U.S. with a Bachelor of Arts in Business. I enjoyed learning gradually and patiently applying my acquired knowledge to different situations. I am currently looking for an opportunity to become an advanced developer in Canada.",
